# 18-Cryptocurrencies-lukeperrin



## Purpose

Using a cryptocurrency dataset ( [crypto_data.csv](Resources/crypto_data.csv) ), we will used unsupervised machine learning to categorize different cryptocurrencies for the purpose of creating a classification system for a new investment portfolio.

## Strategy & Execution

The code to perform this agenda ( [crypto_clustering.ipynb](crypto_clustering.ipynb) ) follows the steps outlined below:

1. Pulls data from source ( [crypto_data.csv](Resources/crypto_data.csv) ) into dataframe

2. Cleans the data in order to isolate the data of interest (namely cryptocurrencies that are tradeable, have coins mined and in supply, and that exhibit a functional algorithm)

3. Prepares data for unsupervised machine learning byâ€¦

   1. Extracts `CoinName` into a independent dataframe to reapply over the index.
   2. Converts text features (i.e. `Algorithm` and `ProofType`) to binary values using `pandas.get_dummies`
   3. Scales the data using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler()`

4. Uses PCA to reduce dimension to three principal components (`PC_1`, `PC_2`, and `PC_3`)

5. Uses an Elbow Curve to find the best value for K (which is determined to be `K=4`):

6. Clusters are predicted with the K-means model

7. Predicted clusters are tabulated and visualized:

## Results

The model was able to cluster the cryptocurrencies as intended (see tables and visualization above or in  [crypto_clustering.ipynb](crypto_clustering.ipynb) ). It was determined that there are 533 tradeable cryptocurrencies.
